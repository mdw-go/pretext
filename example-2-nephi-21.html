And the <span style="color: #09c;">Spirit</span> of the Lord shall rest upon him,
    the <span style="color: #09c;">spirit</span> of wisdom and <span style="color: #9d5;">understanding</span>,
    the <span style="color: #09c;">spirit</span> of counsel and might,
    the <span style="color: #09c;">spirit</span> of knowledge and the <span style="color: #c66;">fear of the Lord</span>,
And shall make him
      of quick <span style="color: #9d5;">understanding</span> in the <span style="color: #c66;">fear of the Lord</span>,
and he shall not <span style="color: #a35;">judge</span> after the sight   of his eyes,
       neither <span style="color: #a35;">reprove</span> after the hearing of his ears.
But with <span style="color: #4d8;">righteousness</span> shall he <span style="color: #a35;">judge</span> the <span style="color: #e94;">poor</span>,
and <span style="color: #a35;">reprove</span> with equity for the <span style="color: #e94;">meek</span> of the <span style="color: #2cb;">earth</span>...
     and <span style="color: #4d8;">righteousness</span> shall be the girdle of his loins,
     and <span style="color: #4d8;">faithfulness</span>           the girdle of his reins.
